# Text-to-speech
### Created a python code in which we take an image as an input, apply various processing on the image to make it clear for the ocr to read and extract text and then convert the text to audio or an mp3 and save it.
### Purpose: Help people with poor visibility to convert the given text and hear the audio.
### Future work: Try integrating the code with an application which will have a button which can convert the text present on the screen of a smart phone and give audio output in real time.
